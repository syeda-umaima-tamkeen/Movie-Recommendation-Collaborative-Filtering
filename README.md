##  Project Summary: Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

This project presents a comprehensive movie recommendation system leveraging collaborative filtering techniques on the MovieLens dataset. The system was designed to suggest relevant movies to users based on their past preferences and similarities with other users or items.

###  Techniques Implemented:
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies by identifying users with similar tastes and aggregating their ratings.
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies similar to those a user has already enjoyed using item-to-item similarity.
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: Decomposes the user-item matrix to reveal latent features and predict missing ratings.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
  - Precision@K to evaluate the relevance of top recommendations.

###  Results & Insights:
- The models achieved high accuracy in recommending relevant content, with low RMSE scores and meaningful Precision@K values.
- Visualization of rating distributions and user similarity matrices provided valuable insights into user behavior and data structure.

###  Strengths:
- Flexible system capable of delivering recommendations using multiple algorithms.
- Scalable approach using real-world MovieLens dataset with over 100,000 ratings.
- Modular code with clear structure, enabling easy extension or deployment.
